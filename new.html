                Question-1: What are the different ways to select an element
                in the DOM?

                <p>
                    In the Document Object Model (DOM), there are several ways to select elements to manipulate or retrieve information.
                    One common method is using <strong>getElementById()</strong>, which selects a single element based on its unique <em>id</em> attribute.
                    Another is <strong>getElementsByClassName()</strong>, which returns a live HTMLCollection of all elements sharing a specific class name.
                    Similarly, <strong>getElementsByTagName()</strong> selects all elements with a given tag name, like "div" or "p".
                    A more versatile method is <strong>querySelector()</strong>, which returns the first element matching a specified CSS selector,
                    while <strong>querySelectorAll()</strong> returns a static NodeList of all elements that match the selector.
                    These methods provide flexibility for targeting elements in various ways, whether through unique identifiers, class names, tags, or complex CSS selector patterns.

                Question-2: What is the difference between innerHTML,
                innerText, and textContent ?

            <div class="p-5 text-lg text-gray-600">
                <p>
                    The properties <strong>innerHTML</strong>, <strong>innerText</strong>, and <strong>textContent</strong> are used to get or set content inside DOM elements, but they work differently. 
                    <strong>innerHTML</strong> deals with HTML content, meaning it returns or sets the HTML markup, including tags and elements inside the selected element. 
                    <strong>innerText</strong> focuses on the visible text content, considering CSS styles like <em>display: none</em> or hidden elements, and ignores any HTML tags within the element. 
                    On the other hand, <strong>textContent</strong> retrieves all the text inside the element, regardless of the styling or visibility, but without including any HTML tags. 
                    In summary, <strong>innerHTML</strong> handles HTML structure, <strong>innerText</strong> deals with visible text, and <strong>textContent</strong> captures all textual content without HTML formatting.

                Question-3: What is event delegation in the DOM?
            </div>
            <p>
                <strong>Event delegation</strong> is a technique in the DOM where a single event listener is added to a parent element 
                instead of attaching individual listeners to each child element. When an event occurs on one of the child elements, 
                the event bubbles up to the parent, allowing the parent to handle the event. This is useful when dealing with dynamic elements 
                that are added to the page after it has loaded, as you do not need to attach separate listeners to each new element. 
                Event delegation improves performance, reduces memory usage, and simplifies code, making it easier to manage events 
                on multiple child elements through a common ancestor.

                Question-4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?
            </div>
            <div class="p-5 text-lg text-gray-600">
                <p>
                    <strong>Event bubbling</strong> is a behavior in the DOM where an event starts from the deepest target element and then 
                    bubbles up through its ancestor elements in the hierarchy. For example, if a user clicks on a button inside a div, 
                    the click event first triggers on the button and then moves up to the parent div, continuing all the way up to the 
                    document body. This allows multiple elements to listen for the same event as it moves upward through the DOM tree. 
                    Event bubbling is useful for handling events at higher-level elements without needing to attach individual listeners 
                    to each child. However, if needed, bubbling can be stopped using the <strong>stopPropagation()</strong> method.

                Question-5: How do you create, add, and remove elements
                using JavaScript?
            </div>
            <div class="p-5 text-lg text-gray-600">
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, you can dynamically create, add, and remove elements in the DOM. 
                    To <strong>create</strong> an element, you use the <strong>document.createElement()</strong> method, specifying the tag name 
                    of the element you want to create. After creating the element, you can add text or attributes to it as needed. 
                    To <strong>add</strong> the new element to the page, you use methods like <strong>appendChild()</strong> or <strong>append()</strong> 
                    to insert it into a parent element. To <strong>remove</strong> an element, you can call the <strong>removeChild()</strong> method 
                    on the parent, or directly use the <strong>remove()</strong> method on the element itself. These methods are commonly used 
                    for building dynamic web pages where content needs to change without reloading the page.
